This folder contains the code used for the FairCG paper. The src folder contains an implementation of the algorithm, and the sample experiments folder contains the jupyter notebooks used to run the experiments. Binerized and split data are included in the latter folder, as well as some generated rulesets. All of the src files should have comments explaining their use (though full documentation is still being finalized/released on a public git version of this repository).
